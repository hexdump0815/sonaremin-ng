i only had to adapt some of them to replace non opensource modules by
opensource ones, as the sonaremin comes only with the plugins which
are available in source form (as they have to be compiled from source
to be able to run them on the arm cpu architecture of the sonaremin). 

a lot of thanks to the creator of those wonderful patches for allowing
them to be included here as sample patches for the sonaremin ...
